The `mitm-certificate.*` files in this directory represent the custom
private key/certificate pair used by BrowerMob Proxy to MITM SSL traffic.
These are intentionally public; don't go installing them as trusted
certificates in your browser or operating system.

* mitm-certificate.keystore is the encrypted form created by the JDK's keytool;
  the password and key alias are specified as constants in TrafficEater.CustomCertificate.
* mitm-certificate.pem is the decrypted PEM-format of the keystore

The keystore file was generated by the GenerateNewCertificate main() method,
and `keytool` and `openssl` were used to export that to a PEM file.
