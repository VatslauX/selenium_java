### Info

This direcrory contains a refactored replica of [aaschmid/junit-dataprovider-and-selenium](https://github.com/aaschmid/junit-dataprovider-and-selenium) project.
It explores [TNG/junit-dataprovider](https://github.com/TNG/junit-dataprovider) (A TestNG-like dataprovider runner for JUnit - `com.tngtech.java.junit.dataprovider` package) with Allure.
This runner can be used as alternative to [allure-examples/allure-cucumber-jvm-example](https://github.com/allure-examples/allure-cucumber-jvm-example) - the two runners can not be combined 
and having both would not make much sense anyway.
