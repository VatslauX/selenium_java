### Note
Deploying phantom seems an heavy requirement for a non it user when the app in question is installed on multiple machine

Selenlium based solution is to avoid, except if if do not use a browser installed on the machine

There is plenty of library as apache, jsoup, why do not try with them ?

```cmd
mvn test
```
```cmd
url https://www.yellowpages.com.au/search/listings?clue=restaurant&locationClue=melbourne&lat=&lon= response: 1005305 char
```
the sample result page is saved in `pagehtml.html`
